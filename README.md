# .NET - Flask - Fast API - Django Comparison

We will compare 4 web frameworks, in this case **.NET 7** which uses **C#**, and 3 **python** web frameworks: **Django**, **Flask** and **FastAPI**. The reason for making this comparison it's because we want to move our dotnet 7 API to some python web framework.  
So first, we will describe all .NET features that our API is using on production, and then we will check if the different python web frameworks have this features by default, needs extra packages or definitely doesn't have the feature.  
Then we are going to **create 4 APIs**, to compare **how much boilerplate files** and **configurations** are needed to create a **single endpoint** that responds a hello world.  
Then we are going to test the 4 APIs to compare it's behaviors on **stress**, **smoke**, **load** and **soak** testing.  

## .NET Features

- Authentication (using JWT)
- Authorization (using decorators and adding claims in every request)
- Database Connection (using MySQL with EntityFramework and SQL Server connections calling queries and stored procedures)
- CORS policies
- Dependency Injection
- HTTP Clients (with base information)
- Swagger (to show api documentation)
- JSON global configuration (to ignore cycles, naming policies and enum converters)
- TLS configuration
- Environments Configurations
- Time Helper (this was a .net framework dll converted to a dotnet core code)

## Benchmarks

In this case we are going to benchmark the hello world api in all 4 web frameworks. We will use [k6](https://k6.io/docs/es/#que-es-k6>) for this tests.

Type of test that we are going to cover:

- Stress tests
- Smoke tests
- Load tests
- Soak tests

## Benchmarks results

### Stress Tests

This test consist in 9 stages:

- 2 min from 0 VUs to 100 VUs
- 5 min with 100 VUs
- 2 min from 100 VUs to 200 VUs
- 5 min with 200 VUs
- 2 min from 200 VUs to 300 VUs
- 5 min with 300 VUs
- 2 min from 300 VUs to 400 VUs
- 5 min with 400 VUs
- 10 min from 400 VUs to 0 VUs
